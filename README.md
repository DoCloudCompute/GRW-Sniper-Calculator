# GRW Sniper Calculator
## bla bla bla
here's the source code, knock yourself out. There's a version for Windows in the portable exe format in the [releases section](https://github.com/DoCloudCompute/GRW-Sniper-Calculator/releases).

## usage
### In Windows
Download the executable in the releases section, as mentioned above.

### For Linux
Execute the [SniperCalc.py](https://github.com/DoCloudCompute/GRW-Sniper-Calculator/blob/master/Linux/SniperCalc.py) script with Python 3.

Required modules are: `cv2, easygui`

In case they're not already installed, execute: `pip install easygui opencv-python`

I recommend to use the Linux version of the script as the Windows one was adapted for portability (hence the base64 encoded version of the reticle image, if anyone comes up with a better solution, please, tell me.)

To change stuff, edit the lines 6 and 7 in the [SniperCalc.py](https://github.com/DoCloudCompute/GRW-Sniper-Calculator/blob/master/Linux/SniperCalc.py) file, according to the comments. I recommend using an image editor like GIMP to get exact pixel values.

For now, I am lacking the other rifles and scope, as you may perhaps, eventually notice. Any help or contribution is welcome, even for things like assault rifles, particularly with the TA31H.
